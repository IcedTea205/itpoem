            Fine as cocoa seeds you sow.
            <br>
            <br>
            Mistaken spirit blooming in the quip
            <br>
            <br>
            You're in a nutshell, not to boredom known,
            <br>
            <br>
            And lightly hovering with acute grip.
            <br>
            <br>
            Your gentle wings embrace us with warm fire
            <br>
            <br>
            And smile, cute riddle of a joy you own,
            <br>
            <br>
            The game and heaven only you desire.

            Comes the night. Of one colour swarms in sight
            <br>
            <br>
            Which is dull. Nor will I attempt to hull,
            <br>
            <br>
            It lights not. Inward lured, you too have got
            <br>
            <br>
            Charon here. He and she the souls with care
            <br>
            <br>
            Lead to cross. With great dignity for loss,
            <br>
            <br>
            You will wait. Nor the last farewell you'll hate.
            <br>
            <br>
            Not to say goodbye you vow.

        <hr>
        <p><b>
            The daughter of Hu came into being, all the world now to be seeing.
            <br>
            <br>
            Flame butterflies flutter like falling plum petals, in a transient dream a fragrance settles.
            <br>
            <br>
            The wind rises, the clouds drift, the impermanence of life is a gift.
            <br>
            <br>
            The flowers bloom the mountains still, and with it the truth reveals.
